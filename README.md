- 👋 Hi, I’m @tb46uk.
- 👀 I’m interested in Cybersecurity and the application of big data in health care.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics as my background is medicine and life sciences with a special interest in oncology.  I promised myself not to be too scared as I venture now in information technology and these new, to me, fields.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on related projects as part of my learning here, initially.  I am also happy to share experiences and skills from my background.
- 📫 Please leave a message here, should you have any ideas, suggestions or projects to discuss.  I would very much appreciate it.
